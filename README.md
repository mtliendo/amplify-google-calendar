# AWS Amplify with Google Calendar Integration

I created this project in Bolt. It's full complete with mock data.

My task is to setup AWS Amplify with Google Calendar so that it pulls from my actual calendar

## Beginning Steps

1. I ran `npm i` to get my dependencies installed.
2. I deleted the `.bolt` folder since it's not longer needed
3. I ran `npm audit --fix` since some deps were out of date
4. I ran the app with `npm run dev` and verified everything worked
5. I commited my code and published to github

## Initial Development
